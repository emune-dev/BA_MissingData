# BA_MissingData

This repository contains all code and simulation scripts for my Bachelor thesis "Missing Data Handling in Amortized Bayesian Inference via Invertible Neural Networks".
It is divided into four folders dedicated to the four investigated models: Conversion reaction model, multivariate normal distribution model (MVN), oscillation model and SIR model.

Regarding the structure/content of these folders: 
- The provided Jupyter notebooks were used to create the plots for performance validation/comparison of trained BayesFlow networks. The names of the notebooks are quite self-explanatory, thus allowing a quick finding of investigated numerical experiment in the thesis
- Subfolders ending with "_ckpts"
- Subfolders entitled "KL loss"
- Subfolders "bayesflow"
