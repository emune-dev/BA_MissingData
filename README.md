# BA_MissingData

This repository contains all code and simulation scripts for my Bachelor thesis "Missing Data Handling in Amortized Bayesian Inference via Invertible Neural Networks".
It is divided into four folders dedicated to the four investigated models: Conversion reaction model, multivariate normal distribution model (MVN), oscillation model and SIR model.
